<h2>Why</h2>

<p>Myself and Glenn Anderson purchased a USB Rocket Launcher each. We already knew that it did not come with Mac OS drivers or software and took the opportunity to fill the gap. Glenn wrote the Mac OS X driver after getting things to work under OS 9. He also wrote a keyboard based program to move the turret and fire.</p><p>
I've taken Glenn's code and built and Cocoa / Objective-C program with Graphical User Interface. Ideas for look and feel have come from around the globe, see references below. The source code has been included with this distribution.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>USB Missile Launcher NZ is only known to work on Mac OS 10.4 and above. A 700+MHz Macintosh may also be required.
</p><p>
Version 1.3.2 of the Missile launcher software works with Mac OS 10.3.9 (and possibly 10.2.8) and supports the DreamCheeky Rocket Launcher. This software release is available in the downloads area of <br>

<p></p>
USB Missile Launcher NZ is known to work on Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard). It has been tested on a 400Mhz G4 (Sawtooth) with both the DreamCheeky Launcher and the origional Missile Launcher. 
<p></p>
The DreamCheeky Launcher seems to require a USB 2 port so the software may not work for this launcher on some older Macs.
<p></p>
+ You will also require a physical USB Missile Launcher, connected with batteries (if it takes them)</p>
