<h2><a name="Main_Window"></a>Main Window</h2>

The window below is the main application window, it is presented when
the application is started.<br>

<img style="width: 507px; height: 385px;" alt="Main Window" src="images/Missile%20Launcher%20-%20Main%20Window.jpeg"><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Connecting your USB
Missile Launcher</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

If no USB Missile Launcher is connected when the program starts up, the
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Launcher Messages</span>"
window tells you that no launcher can be found. The USB Missile
Launcher NZ software supports USB Hot Plug and Play, thus you can
connect a launcher while the software is running. You can also connect
more than one launcher at a time, the software will control all of the
connected launchers. (I've tested two so far!).<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlock the Launcher</span><br>

To&nbsp;begin controlling the USB Missile Launcher you much unlock
the
launcher. The Lock/Unlock slider is a safety feature of the software
that is automatically trigged by a timer. You can change the timer in
the preference settings.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Launcher Messages</span><br>

The software provides feedback to you on manual and automatic actions.
Read the messages &nbsp;in this window to gain a understanding of
what
the software is doing.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Video Camera Support</span><br>

Video Camera support is provided so that if you are in some way able to
mount a Firewire video camera ontop of your launcher, you can see on
screen what the launcher sees. You can optionally record a video
(quicktime movie) of your session. The recorded file is always called
"USB Missile Launcher NZ.mov". If you want to change thus, click on the
button to "Change Capture File".<br>

If you start the software without the camera connected or turned on,
you can turn it on later and click the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Video Window</span>"
button.<br>

If you have more than one camera, click the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Video Settings</span>"
button which will allow you to change your video source amongst other
settings.<br>

Note: the quality of the recorded movie is somewhat better than what is
displayed on screen.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Record/Pause/Stop</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

You can record Missile Launcher quicktime movies by using the buttons
provided. After pressing record the button will change to "Pause". You
can record/pause as often as you like. When you have finished press the
stop button. The program will automatically run Quicktime Player to
display the movie. <br>

<br>

<h2>Launcher Draw</h2>

The window below is displayed as a draw under the main application
window when the launcher safety lock is released.<img style="width: 492px; height: 212px;" alt="Controls" src="images/Missile%20Launcher%20-%20Controls.jpeg"><br>

<br>

Use the arrow buttons to move the USB Missile Launcher in the desired
direction.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Test</span><br>

The test button will rotate the launcher to the top right, back to the
middle (verticle Axis) and back to the middle (horizontal Axis) then
Fire.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Park (no fire)</span><br>

The park button will rotate the launcher to the top right, back to the
middle (verticle Axis) and back to the middle (horizontal Axis). While
doing so the Warning Klaxon will sound.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abort</span><br>

This button has limited functionality. Repeadly pushing this may help
abort a previous action. <br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fire</span><br>

If you don't know what this does....<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fire 3</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Fires all three missiles. A limitation (or safety feature) in the
hardware does not permit faster firing.<br>

<br>

<h2>Video Window</h2>

This is what it looks like, complete with gun sight target.<br>

Note: The gun sight is not recorded in the Quicktime movie at this time.<br>

development and setting priorities for development.<br>

<br>

<h1><a name="Preferences"></a>Preferences</h1>

Preference settings let you alter the way the application works for you.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

The General preferences let you control the number of seconds before
the launcher will "auto lock" - i.e. enable the safety lock.<br>

If you set the number of seconds to zero, the auto lock will not engage.<br>

<img style="width: 338px; height: 266px;" alt="Preferences - General" src="images/Missile%20Launcher%20-%20Preferences%20General.jpeg"><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sound</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

The Sound preferences let you change the default sounds for "Launch"
and "Warning Klaxon".<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Note: the sound timing
can be
sensitive, that is the warning klaxon when played furing the Park
sequence is triggered two or three times.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

Click the Choose button next to each sound type to select a new sound.<br>

Click the Play button to test your sound.<br>

Sound On/Off is self explanitory (I hope!)<br>

<br>

If you really get all mucked up, click the Default button to reset the
application to the default sounds as supplied with the program.<br>
